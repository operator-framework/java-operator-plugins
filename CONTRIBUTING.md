# How to contribute

Java Operator is Apache 2.0 licensed and accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some of the conventions on commit message formatting, contact points for developers, and other resources to help get contributions into the Java Operator.

## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.

## Email and Chat

- Email: [operator-framework][operator_framework]  

## Getting started

- Fork the repository on GitHub

    https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-plugins.git

- If you want to build/run the project, use command
    `TBD`

## Reporting bugs and creating issues

Reporting bugs is one of the best ways to contribute. However, a good bug report has some very specific qualities, so please read over our short document on reporting issues before submitting a bug report. This document might contain links to known issues, another good reason to take a look there before reporting a bug.

## Contribution flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where to base the contribution. This is usually master.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Check your work after running all Unit and Regression Tests. You should run all the unit tests by hitting the following command
    `TBD`
- Push changes in a topic branch to a personal fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to operator-framework/operator-sdk.
- The PR must receive a LGTM from two maintainers found in the MAINTAINERS file.

Thanks for contributing!

### Code style

The coding style suggested by the Java community is used in Java operator. See the [style doc](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for details.

Please follow this style to make operator-sdk easy to review, maintain and develop.

### Format of the commit message

We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer two
questions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the what and
the body of the commit should describe the why.

```
scripts: add the test-cluster command

this uses tmux to setup a test cluster that can easily be killed and started for debugging.

Fixes #38
```

The format can be described more formally as follows:

```
<subsystem>: <what changed>
<BLANK LINE>
<why this change was made>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

### PR Review

Your PR will get reviewed soon from the maintainers of the project. If they suggest changes, do all the changes, commit the changes, rebase the branch, squash the commits and push the changes. If all is fine, your PR will be merged.

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

Feel free to suggest changes to this documentation. If you want to discuss something with maintainers, you can ask us on a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-plugins/issues)

## Documentation

If the contribution changes the existing APIs or user interface it must include sufficient documentation to explain the use of the new or updated feature.
